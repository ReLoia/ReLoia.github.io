## Welcome to my portfolio!
I wanted to create a simple portfolio to showcase my projects and skills.  
The best part of the website is the music player,  
which is powered by my own API that uses the Spotify API to get the music I'm currently listening to.

### Do you want to use the music player?
To do so, you need to clone and edit my API to your liking.

### What did I use to create this website?
The website is built with plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
I love the simplicity of these languages, and I wanted to show that you can create a beautiful website without using frameworks.
